A number of entries contain the name ''CL rather than 'CL
Is this correct? Can these be paired with the corresponding chain
having 'CL (e.g. 3-13'CL light & 3-13''CL heavy)?

Some entries with insertions don't have ANNOTA AAIN records, just
ANNOTA AANT (e.g. 027820, 027821)

Some sequences end up with multiple entries in the database. In
principle this is correct because they are paired with multiple
partner chains. Known examples are all light chains:
020112
034242
019751
029917
004781
However, would be good to have a DISTINCT keyword in searches

Problem 02.12.11
007779 - this has an AAIN at 39 but it comes up as a ? in the sequence
